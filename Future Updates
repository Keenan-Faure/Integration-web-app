updates

- configure $_SESSION['products'] to update once the user lands on the editCustomers/Products.php page, then it will make sense to re-direct 
  the user back there once the product/customer has been added/editted.

- create NavBar to make navigation easier (will require Js, CSS, some HTML)

- decrease the size of the tabs on editCustomer/Products.php for everything besides the html editng fields. (They are just too big)

- Make the update query detect if anychanges has been made

- Fix API endpoints
